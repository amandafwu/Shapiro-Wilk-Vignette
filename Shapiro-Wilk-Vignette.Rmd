##### Like the other Goodness of Fit tests, the **Shapiro-Wilk test** is a test of normality that is used to determine whether a sample came from a normal distribution. The S-W test compares the actual SD of data to the computed SD from the slope of a QQ plot for the data and looks at its ratio. If the data are sampled from a normal distribution, the values should be really similar and the ratio will be close to 1.0. 
  + **Null hypothesis:** the sample follows a normal distribution (p > 0.5); we have failed to reject the null
  + **Alt hypothesis:** the sample does not follow a normal distribution (p < 0.5); the null hypothesis is rejected
  
  
#### Why should you use the Shapiro-Wilk test?
  + Used on one sample with univariate, continuous data 
  + More appropriate method for smaller samples (n<50)
      + May be better for wildlife samples that are typically smaller 


#### Cautions when using the Shapiro-Wilk test
  + The test does not work on larger samples because the test becomes more sensitive to small deviations which leads to the greater probability of rejecting the null hypothesis
  + You shouldn't use the Shapiro-Wilk test when evaluating assumptions for parametric tests (i.e. ANOVA, T tests) because it's too sensitive 
  + Not ideal if several values within the data are identical 


To perform the S–W test for normality, assume that the sample is composed of n independent and identically distributed observations (x1,x2,…xn) from a normal distribution with unspecified mean and variance. If x[1],x[2],…x[n] represents the n observations arranged in ascending sequence, the test statistic is

####### The denominator is essentially the sum of squares equation which calculates variances while the numerator is the estimate slope of the Q-Q plot. The a values are constants generated from the means, variances and co-variances of the order statistics of a sample size (n) from a normal distribution. They incorporate the normal order statistic, the structure of data around the best-fit line, and normalize for the sample size of the data. Ideally, the slope of the Q-Q plot should be equal to the standard deviation if it is normally distributed so if you were to square this value, then it should equal to variance. 
  + If the null hypothesis is true, then the W statistic should be variance over variance (both values are the same) which should equal to one. 
  + If the W statistic is less than one, then there is a difference between the data and its normal distribution 
    + The p value will determine whether the W statistic is significant 


#### Let's conduct a Shapiro-Wilk Test on a normalized distribution to see how it is calculated!
```{r SW creating dataset}
library(ggpubr)
set.seed(123)
normdata <- rnorm(35, mean = 25, sd = 3)
hist(normdata)
qqnorm(normdata)
qqline(normdata, col = "dodgerblue4", lwd = 2)
```

##### As we can see, the data set we created follows the guidelines of being normally distributed data but let's see how to test its normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test.
  + **Null hypothesis:** the data follows a normal distribution
  + **Alt hypothesis:** the data does not follow a normal distribution 

##### In order to calculate the W statistic, here is the following procedure:
  + First, the sample size of n has to be sorted in increasing order adn the resulting sorted sample is designated as y1, y2, ..yn 
  + Then, you calculate the sum of squares using this formula:
  
  + To calculate the numerator, if the sample size is an even number, then it is calculated using k = n/2
    + If the sample size is odd, the median must not be included so it's calculated as k = (n-1)/2 using this formula: 
    
  + The test statistic is finally calculated as W = b^2 / S^2 
    + You analyze the value by using the critical threshold table
      + If the test statistic is smaller than the critical threshold then the assumption of a normal distribution is rejected.
    

```{r SW calculations }
shapiro.test(normdata)
```
The W statistic is really really close to 1 which means there's only a little variation and the p-value is greater than 0.05 which means that we have failed to have rejected the null hypothesis. 


#### Now, let's look at another data set where it may not be of normal distribution. 
```{r SW non normal data}
set.seed(1)
library(dplyr)
dataset2 <- rpois(35, lambda = 3)
hist(dataset2) # looks skewed
qqnorm(dataset2) 
qqline(dataset2, col = "dodgerblue4", lwd = 2)
```

```{r SW not normal dist}
shapiro.test(dataset2)
```
Here, while the W statistic is close to 1, the p-value is less than 0.05 so the null hypothesis is rejected. 


### Challenge 1
ToothGrowth is a data set in R showing the length of teeth of guinea pigs at three Vitamin C dosage levels(0.5, 1 and 2mg) with two delivery methods(orange juice or ascorbic acid). The column ‘len’ shows the tooth length. Test the normality of the distribution of these guinea pigs’ teeth lengths.

```{r SW ToothGrowth}
data("ToothGrowth")
head(ToothGrowth)
hist(ToothGrowth$len)
qqnorm(ToothGrowth$len)
qqline(ToothGrowth$len, col = "dodgerblue4", lwd = 2) #looks fairly normal but might have some difference
```

```{r SW ToothGrowth calculation}
shapiro.test(ToothGrowth$len)
```

Looks to be very normally distributed!
