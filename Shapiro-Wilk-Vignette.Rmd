#### Like the other Goodness of Fit tests, the **Shapiro-Wilk test** is a test of normality that is used to determine whether a sample came from a normal distribution. 
  + null hypothesis: the sample follows a normal distribution (p > 0.5)
  + alt hypothesis: the sample does not follow a normal distribution (p < 0.5)
  
In the Shapiro-Wilk test, the null hypothesis states that if the population is normally distributed (the p-value is greater than 0.05), then the null hypothesis is accepted. The alternative hypothesis states that if the population is not normally distributed (the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05), then the null hypothesis is rejected. 

#### Why should you use the Shapiro-Wilk test?
  + Used on one sample with univariate, continuous data 
  + More appropriate method for smaller samples (n<50)
      + May be better for wildlife samples that are typically smaller 

#### Cautions when using the Shapiro-Wilk test
  + The test does not work on larger samples because the test becomes more sensitive to small deviations which leads to the greater probability of rejecting the null hypothesis
  + You shouldn't use the Shapiro-Wilk test when evaluating assumptions for parametric tests (i.e. ANOVA, T tests) because it's too sensitive 

To perform the S–W test for normality, assume that the sample is composed of n independent and identically distributed observations (x1,x2,…xn) from a normal distribution with unspecified mean and variance. If x[1],x[2],…x[n] represents the n observations arranged in ascending sequence, the test statistic is

####### The denominator is essentially the sum of squares equation which calculates variances while the numerator is the estimate slope of the Q-Q plot. The a values are fixed values that incorporate the normal order statistic, the structure of data around the best-fit line, and normalize for the sample size of the data. Ideally, the slope of the Q-Q plot should be equal to the standard deviation if it is normally distributed so if you were to square this value, then it should equal to variance. 
  + If the null hypothesis is true, then the W statistic should be variance over variance (both values are the same) which should equal to one. 
  + If the W statistic is less than one, then there is a difference between the data and its normal distribution 
    + the p value will determine whether the W statistic is significant 


#### Let's conduct a Shapiro-Wilk Test on a normalized distribution to see how it is calculated!
```{r SW creating dataset}
library(ggpubr)
set.seed(123)
normdata <- rnorm(35, mean = 25, sd = 3)
hist(normdata)
qqnorm(normdata)
qqline(normdata, col = "dodgerblue4", lwd = 2)
```

As we can see, the data set we created follows the guidelines of being normally distributed data but let's see how to test its normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test.
Null hypothesis: the data follows a normal distribution
Alt hypothesis: the data does not follow a normal distribution 

```{r SW calculations }
shapiro.test(normdata)
```
The W statistic is really really close to 1 which means there's only a little variation and the p-value is greater than 0.05 which means that we have failed to have rejected the null hypothesis. 

Let's break apart the equation.. 
```{r SW calculations ss}
# first, we'll calculate the sum of squares: 
ss <- sum((normdata - mean(normdata))^2)   
ss

```
This variable should be our denominator value when calculating the W statistic. 


Now, let's look at another data set where it may not be of normal distribution. 
```{r SW non normal data}
set.seed(1)
library(dplyr)
dataset2 <- rpois(35, lambda = 3)
hist(dataset2) # looks skewed
qqnorm(dataset2) 
qqline(dataset2, col = "dodgerblue4", lwd = 2)
```

```{r SW not normal dist}
shapiro.test(dataset2)
```
Here, while the W statistic is close to 1, the p-value is less than 0.05 so the null hypothesis is rejected. 

Here's a view of the function deconstructed. 
```{r SW Explanation}
function (x) 
{
    DNAME <- deparse1(substitute(x))
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    x <- sort(x[complete.cases(x)])
    n <- length(x)
    if (is.na(n) || n < 3L || n > 5000L) 
        stop("sample size must be between 3 and 5000")
    rng <- x[n] - x[1L]
    if (rng == 0) 
        stop("all 'x' values are identical")
    if (rng < 1e-10) 
        x <- x/rng
    res <- .Call(C_SWilk, x)
    RVAL <- list(statistic = c(W = res[1]), p.value = res[2], 
        method = "Shapiro-Wilk normality test", data.name = DNAME)
    class(RVAL) <- "htest"
    return(RVAL)
}
```


### Challenge 1
ToothGrowth is a data set in R showing the length of teeth of guinea pigs at three Vitamin C dosage levels(0.5, 1 and 2mg) with two delivery methods(orange juice or ascorbic acid). The column ‘len’ shows the tooth length. Test the normality of the distribution of these guinea pigs’ teeth lengths.

```{r SW ToothGrowth}
data("ToothGrowth")
head(ToothGrowth)
hist(ToothGrowth$len)
qqnorm(ToothGrowth$len)
qqline(ToothGrowth$len, col = "dodgerblue4", lwd = 2) #looks fairly normal but might have some difference
```

```{r SW ToothGrowth calculation}
shapiro.test(ToothGrowth$len)
```

Looks to be very normally distributed!
